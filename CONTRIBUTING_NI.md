# Contributing to NI-maintained fork of Grafana

### Branching Policy

Before making any changes, make sure you have read and fully understand the [Branching Policy](https://github.com/ni/grafana/wiki/Branching-policy).

### Changes

Any changes made to this fork should be considered for upstreaming first. If the change in question can be made in a generic way, we should play our part as good open-source citizens and open a PR to the upstream repository before contributing directly to this fork.

This also means that every contribution to this fork will be highly scrutinized, as we are making a conscious effort to stay as close to the mainline as possible. Any new panels or related functionality should be implemented as plugins to avoid changing the first-class panels and further deviating from the mainline.
