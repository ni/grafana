# Contributing to NI-maintained fork of Grafana

### Preface

Any changes made to this fork should be considered for upstreaming first. If the change in question can be made in a generic way, we should play our part as good open-source citizens and open a PR to the upstream repository before contributing directly to this fork.

This also means that every contribution to this fork will be highly scrutinized, as we are making a conscious effort to stay as close to the mainline as possible. Any new panels or related functionality should be implemented as plugins to avoid changing the first-class panels and further deviating from the mainline.

### Overview

The default branch of this repository is _main_, which contains both NI-specific changes and changes we intend to upstream. This branch is always based on a stable tagged commit from Grafana's upstream.

Changes that will be upstreamed will also live in separate topic branches prefixed with _ni/pub/_. These branches should be based on the same tag that _main_ is based on, rather than on _main_ itself. This approach has several benefits:
- PRs can be opened on [grafana/grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) using these branches instead of having to cherry pick commits from _main_.
- Prevents us from accidentally making changes that will be upstreamed dependent on private changes.
- Makes it easier to remove changes that were accepted upstream from our mainline.

### How do I...

#### Make a private change to ni/grafana?

To make changes to the fork that are NI-specific, simply create a topic branch based on _main_, make your changes, and then open a pull request merging your topic branch back into _main_. After the changes are reviewed and accepted, the branch should be **squash merged** and then deleted.

#### Make a change that could be accepted upstream?

In an ideal world, we could make changes to [grafana/grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) directly and then integrate them into our fork after they release a new stable version. However, this could take weeks or months. To keep our development cycles short, these changes need to also be merged into our fork in the meantime.

Create a branch prefixed with ni/pub based on the same tag that ni/grafana's main is based on. Example:
```
# Finds the most recent tag reachable from main
git describe --tags --abbrev=0 main
git checkout -b ni/pub/cool-new-feature <latest-tag>
```

Then make your changes on this branch and open a pull request merging it into _main_. If your changes on an ni/pub/* branch result in merge conflicts with another ni/pub/* branch, rebase your branch on the conflicting branch and force push. After the changes are reviewed and accepted, the branch should be merged **via a merge commit** (not squashing) and **not** deleted. Merge commits will make it easier to undo the changes later on if they are accepted upstream.

#### Integrate a new release of Grafana into the fork?

First, pull the latest tags from upstream:
```
git fetch upstream --tags
git push origin --tags
```
Then ask @mure what to do next, because we haven't gone through this workflow yet ðŸ˜…
